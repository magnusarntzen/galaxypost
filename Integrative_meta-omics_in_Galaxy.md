Integrative meta-omics in Galaxy
================================
By Magnus Ã˜. Arntzen (Norwegian University of Life Sciences) and Bjoern Gruning (University of Freiburg)

**Abstract:** The meta-omics technologies have provided scientists with methods for addressing the complexity of microbial communities on a scale not attainable before. Individually, the different techniques can provide great insight; while in combination, they can provide a detailed understanding of which organisms occupy specific metabolic niches, how they interact, and how they utilize environmental nutrients.  

In this post we will describe the adaption of a repertoire of commonly used omics tools spanning all three technologies (metagenomics, -transcriptomics and -proteomics) into the Galaxy framework, in order to generate a user-accessible, scalable and robust analytical pipeline for integrated meta-omics analysis.  

We have applied this pipeline to deconvolute a highly efficient cellulose-degrading minimal consortium isolated and enriched from a [biogas reactor in Fredrikstad, Norway](http://www.frevar.no/). Metagenomic analysis recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for several constituent populations including *Hungateiclostridium thermocellum*, *Acetomicrobium mobile* and multiple heterogenic strains affiliated to *Coprothermobacter proteolyticus*. Metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analysis revealed co-expression of carbohydrate-active enzymes ([CAZymes](http://www.cazy.org/)) from multiple populations, inferring deeper microbial interactions that are dedicated towards co-degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose. By combining meta-omics methods, we have been able to identify and describe key roles played by specific uncultured microorganisms in complex biomass degradation processes.

**The dataset:** The sample studied in this work originated from a thermophilic biogas-plant operated on muncipal food waste and manure. After a round in a lab-scale reactor, we performed a serial dilution to extinction experiment to simplify and enrich the community for growth on cellulose (Norwegian Spruce).
